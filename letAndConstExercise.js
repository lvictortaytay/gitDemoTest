/*
question 1: what is the difference between VAR and LET?
    - var is a hoisted key word and can be called from anywhere in the scope, whereas let is block scoped meaning if it is within curly braces it cannot be 
    accessed outside of it.

question 2: what is the difference between VAR and CONST?
     - const cannot be reassigned nor can it be redeclared, whereas var can be both reasigned as well as redeclared.

question 3: what is the difference between LET and CONST?
    - const cannot be reassigned whereas let can be.

question 4: what is hoisting
    - this is when the compiler lefts up the defined variable to the highest scope where it is defined in ( using the key word var )
